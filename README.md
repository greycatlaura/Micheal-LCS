Ambulance app
this app allows dispatch and the ambulances to communicate digitally so that ambulances can get their patients to hospitals with the necesary open bed faster
the fisrt page shows the start button and it is intended to be used when dispatch contacts the ambulance
the second page breaks down how critical the injury is by using the same color codes that the emergency responders use
the third page breaks down the injury into types head, lymbs, torso and it further breaks it down to artirial or vein injuries and what lymb
the fourth gives you the list of hospitals available and who is closest 
the fifth page gives the selected hospital and the gps location to that hospital
on the same fifth slide once the ambulance has arrived to the chosen hospital the emt would press end and 
on the last page the start location and time aswell as the end location and time are seen and all information acquired during the time is sent to the hospital 
the ambulance then just goes back to the beginning page and the cycle starts all over.
